### Motivation for Development
As university students living alone or as members of a household, managing the refrigerator often feels like a challenging task.

We wondered, what if there was a service to assist people after theyâ€™ve gone grocery shopping?

This led us to create an app designed to safeguard the world inside the refrigerator and help prevent users from buying duplicate items while shopping.

### Project Overview
This app is designed to make refrigerator management easier by addressing issues like buying duplicate ingredients and keeping track of expired or old items.

Unlike traditional apps that require users to manually enter each item, this app allows users to store item information in one go using QR codes.

When shopping online or offline, the app scans QR codes from electronic receipts (or, where possible, paper receipts) using a smartphone. It then displays product names, quantities, and transaction dates in the app. Users can update their refrigerator inventory with these new items at the touch of a button, making it easy to keep track of their refrigerator contents.

### Expected Benefits

Reduces unnecessary waste and duplicate purchases through efficient inventory tracking.
Offers a reliable post-shopping management service that customers can trust and use regularly.
